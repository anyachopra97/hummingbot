# Perform Trade

## Extending Get Order Book
The Perform Trade extends the Get Order Book strategy by incorporating several new sections of code, specifically, the c_tick, c_place_orders, c_has_enough_balance, and c_process_markets. The new code sections of code achieve the following:

* Execute clock ticks / add temporal aspect (c_tick)
* Place market / limit orders (c_place_orders)
* Check if the trader has a high enough balance to place the requested orders (c_has_enough_balance)
* Process the market during various clock ticks (c_process_markets)

## Architecture

In the Perform Trade strategy, Hummingbot places a single order that is specified by the user. Unlike Simple Trade, orders aren’t cancelled after a certain amount of time and are only placed once at the start of the strategy.

Here's a high level view of the logic flow inside the built-in perform trade strategy.

Specifically, the “Should I proceed?” check in the flow chart occurs in the try clause in the c_tick function. This checks that the markets are ready and connected, ensuring it is safe for the trader. The “Does the user have enough balance to place order?” check in the flow chart occurs on line 193 in the c_place_order function. The if statement calls c_has_enoguh_balance which performs the check. The two following paths of creating a buy order or creating a sell order in the flow chart also occur in the c_place_order function.


The flow of the strategy is as follows

1. Get user input
2. Sanity Checks
3. Place Order


## Sanity Checks & Validation

Before the strategy attempts to perform any trades it checks the following to ensure it is safe to perform the trade:

1. Are both markets ready and connected?
2. Does the user have enough balance?
    1. Additionally, this check triggers a warning and logs the warning. If the user does not have the requisite balance to perform the trade, the interface will display the warning.
    2. To achieve this check, the Perform Trade strategy gets the user’s available balance by using the `c_has_enough_balance()` in [perform_trade.pyx](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/development/hummingbot/strategy/dev_2_perform_trade/dev_2_perform_trade.pyx).

## Managing Order State
Order state is tracked using the quantity, price, type, id, and other attributes.
The OrderTracker class includes functions monitoring when order tracking begins, noticing and tracking cancels, and when tracking ends. When an order is completed an order id is returned and the specifics concerning the order can be determined by using the OrderTracker class.

The order state, specifically, whether the order is partially or completely filled is managed by events in the MarketBase class. Specifically, the logic regarding order creation, cancelation, filling, and completion can be found in the following functions in [market_base.pyx](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/market/market_base.pyx): `buy()`, `sell()`, `cancel()`, `get_order_price_quantum()` (gets the required or allowed order price), and `get_order_size_quantum()` (gets the required or allowed order size).

The order tracking logic can be found in the `c_start_tracking_limit_order()`, `c_stop_tracking_limit_order()`, `c_has_in_flight_cancel()` and `c_check_and_track_cancel()` function inside [order_tracker.pyx](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/strategy/order_tracker.pyx).

## Logging

The Perform Trade strategy includes logging operations for info, warnings, and errors. The info logs include information regarding transactions and is logged with severity info. The warning logs include information regarding warning during a user’s session such as insufficient balance. Finally, the error logs include error information such as the markets being down or being unable to connect to the markets and are stored with severity error.

The log messages are output on the right half of the Hummingbot terminal. An example of an informational log message is in the case where the user does not have enough balance to run the strategy. The right half of the terminal will display “Not enough balance to run the strategy. Please check balances and try again.” An example of a warning log message in the case where the markets are not open or ready would read, "Markets are not ready. No market making trades are permitted."

## History
The history command displays fulfilled orders, the balance snapshot, and performance analysis.
Most importantly for this strategy, the completed trades are shown by querying the database to see which trades have occurred since the start of the session.

The logic for getting the history can be found in the balance_snapshot function and trades list inside [history_command.py](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/client/command/history_command.py) file.
